# SIEM Simulation Lab

**Objective:** Practice a basic SIEM analyst workflow: inspect alerts, check IP reputation, escalate and contain.

## Steps I performed
1. Inspected SIEM dashboard and identified a suspicious IP (redacted here as `<MALICIOUS_IP>`).  
2. Performed reputation checks (AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos, whois).  
3. Confirmed a successful authentication from the suspicious IP.  
4. Escalated the incident to the SOC Team Lead and requested the IP be blocked.  
5. Documented recommended follow-up: password reset for the affected account and log review.

## Skills practised
- SIEM alert triage  
- OSINT for IP reputation  
- Incident escalation and containment

**Note:** All sensitive details (IPs, usernames, timestamps) have been redacted for public posting.
